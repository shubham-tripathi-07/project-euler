Solution of Project Euler 

The questions have been solved using python.

There is no commenting or explanation on how it has been solved. I have been practice coding to get better.

If you want explanations and insight, please find another respository and mathematical explanantions of everything are present on Stack Overflow. 


P.S : Still to add more to README
